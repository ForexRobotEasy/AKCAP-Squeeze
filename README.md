## Convergence Detection

The function `DetectConvergence` is used to detect convergence between Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels. The logic implemented in this function compares the values of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels at each bar. If Bollinger Bands are greater than Keltner Channels at any bar, the function returns `false`, indicating no convergence. If all bars show Bollinger Bands lesser or equal to Keltner Channels, the function returns `true`, indicating convergence.

## Volatility Prediction

The function `PredictVolatility` predicts the likelihood of high volatility periods following a squeeze. It iterates through the `squeezeIndicator` array and counts the number of positive values. The count represents the number of bars where volatility is expected to increase.

## Trade Entry

The function `GenerateEntrySignal` generates trade entry signals based on the AKCAP Squeeze strategy. It uses the values of `squeezeIndicator`, `histogram`, and `momentumLine` arrays at the last bar index to determine the entry signal. If `squeezeIndicator` is positive, `histogram` is positive, and `momentumLine` is positive, the function returns `true`, indicating a valid entry signal. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Trade Exit

The function `DetermineExitPoint` determines the optimal trade exit points based on predefined criteria. It uses the `price` array and compares the last bar's price with the `profitTarget` and `stopLoss` levels. If the price is greater than or equal to the `profitTarget` or less than or equal to the `stopLoss`, the function returns `true`, indicating it's time to exit the trade. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Risk Management

The function `CalculatePositionSize` calculates the position size based on the account balance, risk percentage, and stop loss. It multiplies the account balance by the risk percentage and divides it by the stop loss to determine the position size.

## Backtesting

The function `BacktestAKCAPSqueeze` performs the backtesting of the AKCAP Squeeze strategy using historical data. It iterates through the `price` array and checks if convergence is detected. If convergence is detected, it generates an entry signal using `GenerateEntrySignal`. If an entry signal is generated, it calculates the position size using `CalculatePositionSize`. It then checks for a valid trade exit using `DetermineExitPoint`. If a trade exit is determined, it updates the winning or losing trades count accordingly. Finally, it prints the backtesting results.

## Main Function

The `OnStart` function is the main function that initializes the historical data arrays (`price`, `squeezeIndicator`, `histogram`, `momentumLine`) and defines the strategy parameters (`profitTarget`, `stopLoss`, `riskPercentage`, `accountBalance`). It then calls the `BacktestAKCAPSqueeze` function to perform the backtesting.
